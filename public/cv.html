        <h3>My core principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Semantic HTML</b> - Use the right HTML elements for the right purpose</li>
          <li><b>Accessibility</b> - The web should be usable by anyone, anywhere</li>
          <li><b>Extensibility</b> - Easily extendable code is great to work with</li>
          <li><b>Code quality</b> - Express complex problems in clear and simple code</li>
          <li><b>Performance</b> - People don't like slow websites and apps</li>
          <li><b>Diversity</b> - Equal opportunities for everyone, remove obstacles that impose boundaries</li>
          <li><b>Collaboration</b> - Work together to achieve goals, make use of each other's experience</li>
          <li><b>Mentoring and coaching</b> - Stimulate growth in people by motivation</li>
          <li><b>Move fast</b> - Quick increments give results and valuable feedback sooner</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Professional experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Senior frontend engineer and consultant at
              <a href="https://www.iodigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iO Consultancy</a> in Eindhoven, from
              November 2018 until present. Worked for the following clients:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://www.luminus.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luminus</a> in Brussels - from Jan
                  2023 until present.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Started up a new team to build a new website application for Luminus in NextJS. At the start, I was
                  part of a team researching the various options for the CMS to replace the existing Sitecore CMS,
                  providing the team with insights from a technical perspective and comparing it to the existing setup.
                  During the RFP phase for CMS vendor selection, I was part of the team that evaluated the proposals and
                  gave input for selecting a vendor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a member of the frontend team, I was also involved in developing and maintaining the existing
                  comonent library, which was built in MUI. For the CMS we decided to update our design system and
                  implement the new version into the component library through the use of design tokens. These design
                  tokens would be synchronized to development tokens through the use of the Tokens Studio Figma plugin
                  and Style Dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the project advanced from the RFP phase, I also started onboarding new team members onto the CMS
                  and Design System project to help speed up the development of the new website.

                  Continued development of main Synchronizer application for optimising ship port calls in various ports
                  around the world. Large focus on data clarity and quality, presenting a lot of valuable information to
                  a large user base. Expanded several existing features and developed entirely new features in a large
                  code base.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Did a complete redevelopment of the UI of the Vessel Planner application to improve UX, accessibility
                  and code quality. Wrote an integration test suite to improve upon an untested code base, covering the
                  most crucial parts of the application. This brought the code coverage to ~60% in the first iteration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through Q4 2021 until Q1 2022 I led the effort in creating the PilotTracker application for the Port
                  of Houston to deprecate an older unmaintained piece of software they used before. Keeping an eye on
                  performance, accessibility and user experience, we created an optimised product to track vessel
                  movements and pilots within the port.
